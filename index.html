I helped design a homework assignment process to establish a control group and then assess homework affects. I was able to analyze the results from the common quizzes, employing appropriate analyses to determine the level of knowledge attainment on the topics and to determine if statistically significant differences exist between the two populations of “paper only” homework and online homework only.</p>

                                                    <p>Microstructures of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are fabricated utilizing standard UV lithography. Prefabricated and purified SWNTs are dispersed in aqueous solution with poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) (PSS). Cavities of differing sizes and geometries are fabricated in a photoresist and oxide layer on a silicon wafer to hold the aqueous suspension as it is spin coated. The water is evaporated, followed by removing the photoresist layer in a lift-off procedure to remove all of the excess SWNTs. The final structures were studied with SEM, EDS, and TEM. Electrical properties of the structures were also examined with I-V measurements. This simple and inexpensive fabrication process could allow SWNTs to be incorporated into current semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p>

                                                    <p>I performed a study to determine how HCl and HNO3 could be used to functionalize carbon nanotubes (CNT). Samples of CNTs were sonicated in HCl and HNO3 of various concentrations for various lengths of time. The samples were then studied at Brookhaven National Labs on a NEXAFS beamline. The resulting diffraction pattern was analyzed to determine what carbon – carbon or carbon - oxygen bonds may have been broken for future functionalization. Energy levels for both carbon and oxygen were studied to collaborate the data.</p>

										<h1>Circuits Sequence</h1>
										<p>Developed a year long circuits curriculum lecture and a circuits lab. This included the creation of 8 in class miniature labs in the first circuits course utilizing the Digilent Explorer Board. Online homework using the WebWork platform was created for the sequence. Each course includes 23-27 assignments for a 10 week quarter. Those WebWork problems are currently being adapted for inclusion in a collection of engineering problems (Open-source Problems in Engineering Studies).<br></p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h1>Digital Design</h1>
										<p>Developed a curriculum to utilize a Xilinx FPGA on a Digilent Nexys (2/3/4) development board. Lectures were created as Google Drive presentations to be sharable and cross platform. Multiple projects using the FPGA development board were designed from Digilent's "Real Digital" course material. The projects have students create basic digital components on the FPGA in Verilog. The projects were grouped in 8 assignments for a 10 week quarter.<br></p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h1>Embedded Systems</h1>
										<p>Created a new projects based course on embedded systems using Xilinx's softcore processor MicroBlaze. The course covers state machines, hardware and software button debouncing, assembly programming, hardware debugging, and FreeRTOS. Students are given 1-2 projects each week with 1 project focusing on programming concepts and 1 project targeting embedded specifics.<br></p>

                                                <p>The world is becoming a smaller place between advancing communication technologies and the global economics of trade. This places higher demands on graduates because they are truly competing with those from around the world. Being the best school in a state or region is no longer enough to be competitive. Schools must be among the best in the world if they want their graduates to be competitive in the workplace. Graduates must distinguish themselves by going the extra mile, and they cannot be satisfied with the bare minimums. This standard is important in the upper level courses, but it is critical in regards to the fundamental courses. These courses are where students get a foundation of engineering principles across all disciplines. If students are not held to the highest standard in those courses the upper level material will have no basis to build out from. A solid foundation in engineering not only prepares students for following courses, but builds a path for future of lifetime learning. By requiring students to solidly grounded in engineering fundamentals, you not only equip them for future classes, but also for a changing world.</p>

                                                <p>High quality students begin with high quality instructors. Students are ultimately responsible for their own performance, but students cannot be expected to have the drive to excel if they see an instructor who is not putting forth effort in and out of the classroom. Teaching is demanding and time consuming work, but an instructor is responsible to be active in class and not just echoing words on a page. Instructors must be a participating member in the classroom, answering questions, monitoring progress, and filling in details or explanations in real time with the need of the students. An instructor is also responsible for creating an environment, not only where learning can occur, but where excelling is encouraged and rewarded. Instructors must treat all students fairly, allowing them to be equally rewarded based on their performance. The instructor must also avoid any grade 'welfare' that discourages students from working hard, knowing that mediocre work will allow them to get by. Finally, an instructor must be available outside of the classroom. Students will have questions and an instructor must create an environment that welcomes questions as well as feedback from the students. Instructors are busy, but they must be available outside of class to give extra instruction, feedback, or encouragement to students on a more one-on-one situation. Instructors must demand the best from students, but to do that, they must first give their best.</p>
                                                
                                                <h2>Application is a Necessity</h2>
                                                <p>Engineering principals have widespread real world applications. However, it becomes easy to miss those applications in the mess of equations, variables, and terminology. Tying what is happening in the classroom to what goes on in the real world does several important things. First, it aids learning by giving tangible examples to help explain difficult engineering concepts. Second, it encourages learning by showing students what they are studying in the classroom is not only useful, but also will be necessary when they graduate. Finally, application motivates learning by making engineering exciting and interesting. Working long tedious equations can get dull and boring. Bringing in a real world example or demonstration can be a breath of fresh air. The heart of engineering is not just a set of concepts or equations, but the application of those principles, so teaching engineering requires application.</p>
                                                
                                                <h2>To See is to Understand</h2>
                                                <p>An engineering education requires more than just the memorization of some equations or derivations. Engineering is about applying concepts and principles to solve real world problems. To fully understand real world concepts requires more than just knowing an equation. Some concepts are difficult to visualize and fully comprehend by just seeing it on paper. When that concept is demonstrated with materials the students can identify with, students gain a more robust understanding. The concepts in engineering must be made tangible to students to allows them to not only understand at a deeper level, but also remember beyond the classroom. Engineering is about physical, real world problems, and to learn that requires seeing them in a tangible manner beyond equations in a book.</p>
                                                
                                                <h2>Demanding Less than the Best is Unsatisfactory</h2>
                                                <p>In education, students will only rise to the bar set by the instructor. If an instructor does not set a high bar, demanding the most of his students, those students will have no reason to excel. Many students have hidden potential that may never come to fruition because they were never really challenged. To produce great students, an instructor must demand his students be great. Students, like all people, do not naturally want to go above and beyond what is required. An instructor must push his students to perform beyond mediocrity to reach their highest potential. Students will rise to the challenge given them. They will do more than even they thought they could do. But that will only happen when an instructor refuses to accept anything less than their best.</p>
